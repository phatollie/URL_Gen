# LinkedIn Secret URL Generator

Description: LinkedIn secret job search URL generator works best when used in a private/incognito browser or when you are logged out of LinkedIn all together. This Secret URL string allows users to browse jobs in a more 'RAW' experience rather than fluffed up with bogus LinkedIn garbage (login, ads, limited frame size, limited results per page, adjusting results based on subscribed companies profiles, 'promoted'). Kind of reminds me back in the day when Monster.com got started based on the same idea providing raw search results, now look at their site with similar usability issues. This URL Gen tool is for geared towards geek engineer types, like me, who prefer clean no fuss search/results. Simple command line using Python 3. The URL generates a secret LinkedIn source and directs users to a basic yet semi-functional LinkedIn HTML site which operates outside the "normal" login requirements wrapper. Use it while you still can!
